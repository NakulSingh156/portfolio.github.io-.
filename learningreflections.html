<section id="problem-nature">
    <h3>Kinds of Problems in Nature</h3>
    <p>Problems in nature often involve patterns of iteration, recursion, or backtracking. These can be identified in biological processes, such as growth patterns, or computational tasks, such as traversing trees or graphs.</p>
</section>

<section id="efficiency">
    <h3>Space and Time Efficiency</h3>
    <p>Space and time efficiency are crucial in ensuring algorithms perform well as the problem size grows. We study different orders of growth like O(n), O(log n), and O(n^2), as well as how these affect real-time systems.</p>
</section>

<section id="design-principles">
    <h3>Design Principles from Chapter 2</h3>
    <p>Weâ€™ve learned various principles of design, including abstraction, modularization, and the importance of understanding trade-offs between simplicity and optimization in solving complex problems.</p>
</section>

<section id="tree-data">
    <h3>Hierarchical Data and Tree Data Structures</h3>
    <p>Different tree structures, such as BST, AVL trees, and heaps, are used to optimize search and insertion operations. By understanding the properties of these trees, we can design efficient systems for handling large datasets.</p>
</section>

<section id="array-query">
    <h3>Array Query Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Array-based algorithms, including range queries and dynamic programming approaches, are crucial for efficiently processing and analyzing large data sets in real-time applications like databases and search engines.</p>
</section>

<section id="tree-graphs">
    <h3>Tree vs Graphs and Their Traversals</h3>
    <p>Trees and graphs differ in their structure and traversal techniques. Tree algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are used to navigate hierarchical data, while graphs are used for more complex, interconnected data structures like social networks.</p>
</section>

<section id="sorting">
    <h3>Sorting and Searching Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Sorting algorithms (e.g., QuickSort, MergeSort) and searching techniques (e.g., Binary Search) are foundational in data processing. They are applied in everything from databases to file systems and web search engines.</p>
</section>

<section id="graph-algorithms">
    <h3>Importance of Graph Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Graph algorithms are essential for solving problems like finding the shortest path or spanning tree, which are crucial in applications like network design, route optimization, and social network analysis.</p>
</section>

<section id="design-techniques">
    <h3>Algorithm Design Techniques</h3>
    <p>We studied various algorithm design paradigms, including divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming, to create efficient solutions for complex problems. These techniques help balance between time complexity and space constraints.</p>
