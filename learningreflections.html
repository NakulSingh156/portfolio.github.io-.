        <h2>Course Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" course! In this course, we will explore the core concepts and techniques
            that are fundamental for writing efficient and optimized algorithms. We will learn how to organize, manage, and process data
            using various data structures and algorithms. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The primary focus of the course is to help us understand the theoretical aspects of algorithms and several data structures while also
            applying them to solve real-world problems. The course aims to provide us with the tools to think critically about
            performance, time and space complexity, and scalability when dealing with large datasets or complex problems.

        <h2>Data Structures and Algorithms we are going to Study</h2>
        <p>
            Throughout the course, you will study the following key data structures and algorithms:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trees</strong> –  Hierarchical data structures, such as binary trees, AVL trees, and B-trees, useful for searching, sorting, and structuring data.</li>
            <li><strong>Binary Search Trees</strong> – Used to efficiently store and retrieve ordered data, allowing for fast search, insertion, and deletion operations..</li>
            <li><strong>Red and Black Trees</strong> – Self-balancing BST that ensures logarithmic time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion by using specific color-based balancing rules..</li>
            <li><strong>BFS and DFS</strong> – BFS explores a graph level by level, while DFS explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking..</li>
            <li><strong>Graphs</strong> – Data structures for modeling relationships between entities (e.g., social networks, route maps).</li>
            <li><strong>Sorting Algorithms</strong> – Techniques like QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search, and more, to efficiently organize and locate data.</li>
            <li><strong>Heap</strong> – Where each parent node is either greater than or smaller than its child nodes, enabling efficient priority queue operations..</li>
            <li><strong>Pattern Searching</strong> – Algorithms that make locally optimal choices in the hope of finding a global optimum.</li>
            <li><strong>Graph Algorithms</strong> – Algorithms such as Dijkstra's and BFS for finding the shortest path, maximum flow, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="real-world-applications">
        <h2>Connecting Design and Analysis of Algorithms with Real-World Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding algorithms and their application in data structures is crucial for solving complex real-world problems. By mastering these concepts,
            you will be able to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design highly optimized search engines (using efficient sorting and searching algorithms).</li>
            <li>Develop applications like social media platforms or navigation systems (using graphs, trees, and dynamic programming).</li>
            <li>Improve the performance of web applications through optimized data handling (using stacks, queues, and hash tables).</li>
            <li>Build systems capable of processing large datasets quickly and efficiently (through the use of efficient algorithms and data structures).</li>
            <li>Enhance problem-solving skills in interviews and competitive programming.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For instance, algorithms used in sorting and searching are the backbone of e-commerce websites when filtering products based on
            specific criteria. Graph algorithms are fundamental in finding the shortest route on mapping applications like Google Maps.
            The skills you acquire will not only be important in software development but also in many fields such as machine learning,
            data science, and artificial intelligence.
