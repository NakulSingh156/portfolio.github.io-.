            <h2>Course Project Introduction</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The project focuses on applying data structures and algorithms to design solutions for urban planning. After reading the white paper on smart cities, we identified a set of problems in the context of city design, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimizing traffic flow using graph algorithms.</li>
            <li>Improving resource allocation using dynamic programming.</li>
            <li>Building efficient routing systems for delivery services using Dijkstra’s or A* algorithm.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The business cases were identified by analyzing the current challenges faced by cities and industries in managing resources, transportation, and urban growth. We split the project into smaller components, with each team member working on a specific aspect.</p>

        <h3>Problem Definition</h3>
        <p>Our team is focused on creating a dynamic, scalable system to optimize traffic in a smart city. We aim to integrate real-time data into an algorithmic solution that reduces congestion, improves traffic flow, and helps city planners make data-driven decisions.</p>

        <h3>Team Members</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Member 1:</strong> Traffic Flow Optimization (Algorithm Design)</li>
            <li><strong>Member 2:</strong> Resource Allocation Modeling (Dynamic Programming)</li>
            <li><strong>Member 3:</strong> Routing System for Delivery Services (Graph Algorithms)</li>
            <li><strong>Member 4:</strong> Data Collection and Analysis (Real-Time Data Integration)</li>

            <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In this section, each team member reflects on their learning from the course, focusing on the following aspects:</p>

        <h3>1. Problem Types and Techniques</h3>
        <div class="sub-section">
            <p>In the real world, we encounter problems that require different strategies for solution. Some common problem types include:</p>
